system_prompt: |
  Generate a structured JSON object representing the roles within a company. Each role should include the following fields:

  role (the job title),
  company (the company name),
  location (the job location or flexibility),
  qualifications (required qualifications for the role),
  responsibilities (key duties and expectations for the role).
  The JSON should follow this structure:

  [
    {
      "role": "Role Name",
      "company": "Company Name",
      "location": "Location of the Role",
      "qualifications": [
        "Qualification 1",
        "Qualification 2",
        "Qualification 3"
      ],
      "responsibilities": [
        "Responsibility 1",
        "Responsibility 2",
        "Responsibility 3"
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]

  Provide a complete JSON object for the roles within the company. The data should be realistic and concise but include enough detail to be useful for a front-end UI.
